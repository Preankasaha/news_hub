            Q-1. what are the differences between regular functions and arrow functions?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
            <p>Ans. Arrow functions – a new feature introduced in ES6 – enable writing concise functions in JavaScript.
                While
                both regular and arrow functions work in a similar manner, yet there are certain interesting differences
                between them. Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are ‘constructible’
                and
                ‘callable’. Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the ‘new’ keyword.
                However,
                the arrow functions are only ‘callable’ and not constructible. Thus, we will get a run-time error on
                trying
                to construct a non-constructible arrow functions using the new keyword.</p>

            Q-2: what are the differences between map(), forEach(), filter() and find() methods in JavaScript?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
            <p>Ans. .map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated
                elements.
                </br>
                .forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array
                and
                it returns undefined.
                </br>
                .filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array
                with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.
                </br>
                .find() is also a search function like the previous but they differ in one small detail — this function
                returns only one match in an array.

            Q-3: Why do we use template string in JavaScript?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content">
            <p>Ans. Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us
                insert/interpolate
                variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of
                JavaScript.
                It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements. Another great thing that
                comes
                with template strings are tags. Tags are functions that take a string and the decomposed parts of the
                string
                as parameters and are great for converting strings to different entities.</p>
